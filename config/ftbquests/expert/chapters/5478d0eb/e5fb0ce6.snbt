		"The Ball of Moss is an invaluable modifier, even at late game. Tools with the modifier slowly automatically repair themselves. This saves a ton of resources because you won't have to repair the tool ever. Also, if you want to get the Sharpness upgrade, 3 Certus Quartz is an entire level as opposed to the giant amount of Nether Quartz it would usually take.",
